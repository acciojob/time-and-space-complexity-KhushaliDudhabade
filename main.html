	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>The Time Complexity of an algorithm/code is not equal to the actual time required to execute a particular code, but the number of times a statement executes. It is efficient to calculate time complexity</p>
	<p>The ability to calculate space complexity is essential in considering an algorithm’s efficiency. In this section, we’ll analyze the space complexity of a few programs of differing difficulty. We’ll measure it using big-O notation O(n).</p>
